We are the use
And we are the people
'Cause no one preachin' from top the steeple
Connected together
The grandest place ever
[?], [?], [?] maximum
'Cause I got no escape
I got no dramaty
You down backin' again
And it's a leap of free
Be what you want to be
We have to wait and see
Addictive company
MY RULES
MY DESTINY

Heyya, what's up ya?
No they can fade us, join this [?]
I say, "Heyya, what's up ya?"
It's not a fleak speech
Let's make it real

Can you feel it?
It's gonna blow your mind
All your dreams could be mine
Don't freak out, it's you and I
Can you feel it?
It's gonna blow your mind
All your dreams could be mine
Don't freak out, it's you and I

'Cause you got no escape
You got no remedy
You jump back in the game
And it's a leap of free
Be what you want to be
We have to wait and see
Addictive company
YOUR RULES
YOUR DESTINY
