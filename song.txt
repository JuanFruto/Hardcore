We are the use
And we are the people
'Cause no one preachin' from top the steeple
Connected together
The grandest place ever
[?], [?], [?] maximum
'Cause I got no escape
I got no dramaty
You down backin' again
And it's a leap of free
Be what you want to be
We have to wait and see
Addictive company
MY RULES
MY DESTINY

Heyya, what's up ya?
No they can fade us, join this [?]
I say, "Heyya, what's up ya?"
It's not a fleak speech
Let's make it real
